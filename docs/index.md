## What is Moonlit?

Moonlit is a build and release automation tool designed to simplify and streamline your release pipeline. It provides a flexible, plugin-based architecture that allows you to automate complex release processes for various project types with a simple YAML configuration file. Moonlit can work with many different technologies including Docker, NPM, and more.

Even this docs site you are reading right now is built with Moonlit! üòÆ All the nuget packages part of the Moonlit toolset, including the CLI are built with Moonlit as well! ü§Ø

## Installation

```bash
dotnet tool install --global moonlit-cli
```

## Quick Example

This is just one example of what Moonlit can do. Moonlit can work with various project types and technologies, not just .NET projects. See the [Plugins](/plugins/) section for more examples, including Docker and NPM integrations.
